<!-- FAQs Section -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <h3>1. Do TV backlights really help reduce eye strain?</h3>
  <p>Yes, especially in dark rooms. TV backlights help reduce the contrast between the bright screen and a dark environment, minimizing strain on your eyes during extended viewing sessions.</p>

  <h3>2. Can I use these backlights with streaming apps on my smart TV?</h3>
  <p>Only some systems, like those with external cameras (e.g., Govee T2 or Ambivision), can sync with native smart TV apps. HDMI-based systems like Lytmi Neo require external devices such as Fire Stick, Apple TV, or gaming consoles for full functionality.</p>

  <h3>3. What’s the difference between RGB and RGBIC backlights?</h3>
  <p>RGB backlights can display one color at a time, while RGBIC (Independent Control) allows multiple colors to appear on a single strip simultaneously, enabling advanced effects and smooth gradients.</p>

  <h3>4. Do I need Wi-Fi to use smart TV backlights?</h3>
  <p>Most advanced backlight systems do require a Wi-Fi connection to access features like app control, syncing, and voice assistant integration. However, some basic LED strips can run without Wi-Fi using IR remotes or Bluetooth.</p>
